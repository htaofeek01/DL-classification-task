# Deep Learning
This repo contains a computer vision project on image classification(Cat vs Dog)

## Technologies
- Pytorch
- Python script
- HTML, CSS, JS
  
## Files Structure
- Static: contains the the CSS and JS script for the web app
- templates: contains the HTML files(index.html and base.html)
- Upload: A folder where uploaded images for testing the model are saved.
- app.py: flask app to run the classification system
- model.pth: Deep learning model for classification task
- project2catvsdog_cnn: Python notebook used to train and build the model.

## How To Use The App
- Clone or download the project file as zip
- Unzip and create a virtual env for the project
- Install the necessary dependency (torchvision, flask)
- Run the flask app.py
- Incase you need to rebuild or tweak the model, check through the python notebook
